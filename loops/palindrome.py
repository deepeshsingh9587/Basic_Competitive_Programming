#  You are given an integer A as input, and you need to determine whether it is a palindrome
# or not. A palindrome integer is one whose digits, when reversed, result in the same number.
# For example, 121 is a palindrome because its reverse is also 121, but 123 is not a palindrome
# because its reverse is 321.Note: The given integer will not have any leading zeros.

n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
temp = n
rev = 0

while n > 0:
    rev = rev * 10 + (n % 10)
    n //= 10

if temp == rev:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not Palindrome")
